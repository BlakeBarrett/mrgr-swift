# About mrgr

mrgr was the product of a self inflicted project to write and release an app in 24 hours.
After the initial release, it was decided to spend some more time and polish what was there and add some features that would make this app better; thatâ€™s how v2 came about.

mrgr was made by Blake Barrett in San Francisco.
